installation of git and GitHub:-

intsllation of git and GitHub.
*****************************
GIT ->  https://git-scm.com/downloads/win

GITHUB ->https://github.com/
- create account -> email -> password -> username ->

puzzle -> create for free -> login

-> create new repository -> repo name -> public -> create repository.

- we have to work on pushing and pulling the code into repo by using "GIT COMMANDS".


- before pushing and pulling the code for the very firsttime in GIt ,
- we have to configure the settings like email & username.

- git config --global user.email "example@gmail.com"

- git config --global user.name "username"


commands:-
***********
git init :- this command initialize the repository in the local machine.
- once repo inttilized all the files inside the folder will be in untracked files list.

git status :- to check the status of the changes in the file/folder

git add filename:- to add the untracked file to stagin area(tracked files).
- when we have multiple file for tracking we use the command called "git add ."
- once we use thid above command all untracked files become tracked files and they are ready to push into remote repo.

 git commit -m "message":- this command is used to write commit messages for the changes done for the files.

git push:- it is used to push the tracked files from local repo to remote repo.
1.  git remote add origin "url of the remoterepo"
2.  git push -u origin master

git log:- this command is used to see the log history.

note:- once we push the code to the remote repo and again if we made some changes in the file that changes will not update directly on the remote repo.
	we have to commit again and we have to push it agin to remote repo by using commands like git add . , git commit  , git push.

git clone:-it is used to clone the copy of repo into local ,machine

 Monday]

In your browser if we want to reun javaScript file ot the CSS file We must connect those file to html file {important Note}

Interview Questions 
1. why we use html IN js
2. importance of DOC file 

---DATA TYPES
--types of datatypes
1. premitive 
-Build In 
-Immutable
-they can store only a single values
  -string
  -number
  -Boolean 
  -undefined
  -null
  -symbol data type , and Big integer
2. non premitive
--user defined 
--mutable
--they can store multiple values
--objects
--math,date,json

--Strings
 -let str11="dinesh"
  console.log(str1);
  console.log(typeof(str11));

--let num = 10 
console.log(num);
-console.log(typeof(s

--let bool1=
-- return type of null is object .
--Undefined (the variables doesnot contain anything, variable is declared but the variable is not in inialized).
let a;
console.log(a)
--bigint any value exceed the range of 
console.log(2n,typeof(x));
disadvantage is security.[
java with high security.[encapsulation]

git init
--git[add.
git commit -m "puhsing 
git remote add origin {GitHub repostery path}
git push origin {GITHUB REPOSTERY PATH}
